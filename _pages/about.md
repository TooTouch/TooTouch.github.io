My name is Jaehyuk Heo (a.k.a **TooTouch**). One day, my friend told me that I look like a mole reads "tootouch" in Korean pronunciation, and since then, my nickname is TooTouch. Actually, I'm not sure I look like a mole. :)

<h1 align='center'>Research Interests</h1>

My research interests are **interpretable artificial intelligence** and **computer vision**. The goal is to make machine learning easy for anyone to understand and use. Through a machine learning model that people can understand, i want to create a service that can provide good results at a low cost for many protected people who are unable to access quality services.
